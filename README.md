# How to start working?
Just run the code and then call function "crawler()".
# How it works?
First of all, the user can choose to do the depth search or breadth search. First one is based on vising the first link on the page every time, the breadth search is based on visiting the links on the start page one by one, in both cases you can choose the depth/breadth. Also you can extract text, images and audios from each visited page, choosing the amount of it.
